# Basic Task Manager

This bootcamp project is a simple, web-based task manager designed to help users organize their to-dos efficiently. Users can add tasks by specifying a task name and description, which will be displayed in an open task space. Each task can be marked as complete or deleted if no longer needed. The project includes a filter feature that enables users to easily sort and view tasks based on their status: all tasks, completed tasks, or uncompleted tasks. This basic task manager is a great introduction to web development essentials, covering form handling, data manipulation, and dynamic DOM updates.

## Lessons Learned

This bootcamp project consists of seven key lessons: (1) Mastering the Command Line Interface (CLI), (2) Git and GitHub, (3) HTML, (4) CSS Basics, (5) Intermediate CSS, (6) JavaScript, and (7) DOM Manipulation. Completing these lessons gave me a solid understanding of foundational concepts, emphasizing their importance and practical applications. Each lesson included quizzes to reinforce the material, helping us retain core concepts.

In the final stage, we were assigned a project to build a basic task manager, with a primary focus on DOM manipulation. This project provided a deeper understanding of JavaScript, allowing me to apply what I learned. I encountered and resolved a few common coding errors along the way, which gave me valuable problem-solving experience. While the project was not overly challenging, it taught me the importance of independently troubleshooting and finding solutions.
